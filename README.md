# Pipu

üî• hellishly fast and ü§è tiny async/sync pipe operator for typescript.

---

## Installation

```bash
yarn add pipu # pnpm add pipu
```

---

## Concept

Pipu is designed to be as low-level and unopinionated as possible so you can build your own abstractions on top of it.

It supports both sync and async modes. That means you can use sync to solve problems where sync fits the job best and async where async fits the job best.

## Pipeables

Pipeables are functions that you can put into a pipe (pipe itself is `Pipeable`).

There's just a few core pipeables so it's easy to build your own abstractions on top them.

*(but I'm open to ideas and PRs regarding new pipeables)*

### filter

Pipeable which runs either `truePipeable` or `falsePipeable` based on return value of `predicate`.

By default `truePipeable` returns `Ok<$Input>` and `falsePipeable` returns `Err<Error<"FILTER", $Input>>`.

```ts
filter((v: number) => !(v % 2));

filter(
  (v: number) => !(v % 2),
  () => ok("even"),
);

filter(
  (v: number) => !(v % 2),
  () => ok("even"),
  () => ok("odd"),
);
```

### map

It maps value from `$Input` to `$Output` and returns it as `Ok<$Output>`.

```ts
// Pipeable<number, Result<string, Error>>
const doubleString = map((v: number) => `${v * 2}`);
```

### wrap

Pipeable which wraps a sub-pipeable and overrides its `Error`.

It's recommended to use `error` function to create a custom `Error`.

```ts
// Pipeable<number, Result<number, Error<"CUSTOM", number>>>
wrap(
  map((v: number) => v * 2),
  error("CUSTOM"),
);
```

### and

Pipeable which takes N number of pipeables and returns either `Ok` returned by the last pipeable or `Err` returned by any of the pipeables.

```ts
// Pipeable<number, Result<string, Error<"FILTER", number> | Error<"CUSTOM", number>>>
const customPipe = pipe(
  filter((v: number) => !(v % 2)),
  wrap(
    map((v) => `${v}`),
    error("CUSTOM"),
  ),
);
```

### or

Pipeable which takes N number of pipeables and returns either `Ok` returned by any of the pipeables or `Err` if none of the pipeables returned `Ok`.

```ts
// Pipeable<number, Result<number, Error<"OR", number>>>
const customPipe = or(
  filter((v: number) => !(v % 2)),
  filter((v: number) => !(v % 3)),
);
```

### resolve

Async pipeable which tries to resolve a promise and return `ResultOk`.

```ts
// PipeableAsync<number, Result<number, Error<"PROMISE", number>>>
const getUsersByAge = and(
  filter((age: number) => age > 18),
  resolve((age) => api.getUsersByAge(age)),
);
```

---

## Utils

### error

Creates error tuple based on value and potential sub-error.

It should mainly be used in `wrap` function as a second parameter.

All `Pipeable`s should return error created with this function.

```ts
error("TEST", (value, error) => ({ valueType: typeof value, error }));
```

### parse

Allows to run `Pipeable` with `unknown` input while infering everything else from the `Pipeable` as usual.

```ts
const isStringOrNumber = pipe(...);
// ResultErr<["OR", [], { }]>
const result1 = parse(isStringOrNumber, []);
// ResultOk<1>
const result2 = parse(isStringOrNumber, 1);
```
